## H2 Challenge

# Description

In this project, we were tasked with creating refactoring a work schedule that changes the date daily, you are able to type and save your daily schedule, will be able to save
to the local storage within Chrome and various platforms, and then will have the ability to refresh or come back to the webpage and the information stored will still be there.
